# Classification-of-Diabetes-Using-Various-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia, 

resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The two main types of diabetes 

are Type 1 diabetes, where the body fails to produce insulin, and Type 2 diabetes, where the body 

becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough. Effective management and timely 

diagnosis of diabetes are crucial to prevent severe complications such as cardiovascular diseases, 

kidney failure, and nerve damage.

This report delves into the classification of diabetes using four prominent machine learning 

algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, and Linear 

Regression. Each of these algorithms brings unique strengths to the table and has been widely 

utilized in medical diagnostics due to their ability to handle complex, multi-dimensional data and 

provide accurate predictions.
